# MAiRA Point Cloud Processing

This repository contains software tools developed for my Engineering Thesis: *"Application of cognitive robots in manufacturing processes"*.

The project focuses on external processing of 3D scan data exported from the **Neura Robotics MAiRA** cognitive robot. The provided Python script utilizes the **Open3D** library to transform raw point clouds into reconstructured 3D meshes.
